    <p>Edward Jenner was an English country doctor in the late 1700s.</p>
    <p>In his practice, smallpox was one of the most common and worst problems he encountered. Smallpox at that time was greatly feared and was a major killer of the young. Jenner used keen observation skills and a lot of daring that wouldn’t be possible today to pave the way for all vaccinations.</p>
<p>In the farm community where Jenner worked, a large majority of the farmers were cattle farmers. In 1788, an epidemic hit the small town of Gloucestershire where he practiced medicine and he noticed that the cattle farmers were not the ones dying from smallpox.</p>
<p>The only treatment available at the time was to inoculate healthy people with the liquid from the pustules of people with mild cases of the disease. This worked sometimes, but often had fatal results. Jenner theorized that cowpox (a much milder but similar disease to smallpox) was somehow protecting the farmers.</p>
<p>In 1796 he had the opportunity to prove his theory correct. A young milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes came to see him about sores she had developed on her hands. He identified them as cowpox. He carefully extracted some liquid from the sores and set about proving that cowpox could protect against smallpox. His method would be illegal today but he bravely or foolishly (depending on your perspective) persevered.</p>
<p>He approached a local farmer and asked if he could inoculate his son, James Phipps, with the cowpox. He explained that if he was correct, his son would never catch smallpox. Given the fear that surrounded smallpox, the farmer agreed. So, Dr. Jenner made two small cuts on the boy’s arm and poured in the cowpox and bandaged the arm. Soon, the boy was ill with cowpox, but not terribly ill and he made a complete recovery. Then Dr. Jenner really made a rash and dangerous move. He repeated his prior experiment but this time he used liquid he had extracted from a patient with a mild case of smallpox.  If his theory was correct, the boy would not get sick, if he was wrong the patient could die and he would be a murderer. Everyone was thrilled when the boy did not get smallpox and Jenner had proved his theory.</p>
<p>The remarkable thing about Jenner’s discovery of vaccination is that it came before people knew that viruses existed or much about the immune system. He used his observation of case studies to fit the puzzle pieces together and start a truly lifesaving procedure. His idea was met with widespread skepticism but he persisted in spite of the resistance he met. There was even a cartoon drawn making fun of his theory showing people developing cow parts after vaccination. <a href="http://www.scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=240&Itemid=216">Source</a></p>
